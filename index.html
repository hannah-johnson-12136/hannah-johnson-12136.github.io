        <p>
            For the most part I have always lived in Texas. I used to live in a nothern state but I was super young. I have lived most of my life here. I plan on graduating high school soon and going off to college.

            After college I want to go live in a nothern state again. I like the cold weather and love to ski. I like having all four seasons and hiking is something I love to do. I'm hoping to own my own house one day and maybe a few dogs and a horse.
